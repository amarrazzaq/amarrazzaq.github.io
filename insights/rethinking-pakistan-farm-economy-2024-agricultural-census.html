<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Pakistan’s agriculture sector is at a crossroads. As the backbone of
the economy, agriculture employs about 40% of the labor force and
contributes around 24% of GDP. Beyond economics, it underpins food security and rural
livelihoods for tens of millions. Recognizing the sector’s critical
role, Pakistan has a long history of agricultural censuses (six prior
censuses since 1960), as well as standalone livestock and machinery
counts. These efforts
provide invaluable data on land use, farming practices, and rural assets
to guide policy. The newly released 7th Agricultural Census
2024 marks a milestone as the first integrated digital
census of agriculture in Pakistan’s history. This integrated approach combined what were
once separate surveys – covering farm lands, livestock, and agricultural
machinery – into one comprehensive exercise, leveraging modern
technology for data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>This commentary distills the main findings of the
7th Agricultural Census and discusses their implications at both the
national and provincial levels. We focus on five key themes emerging
from the census data: landholding patterns, irrigation and water
usage, livestock trends, farm mechanization, and digital data
collection. For each theme, we highlight important trends and
disparities (including differences among provinces) and identify
challenges or gaps facing Pakistan’s agriculture. We then offer curated,
actionable policy recommendations aimed at policymakers, stakeholders,
and the public to address these challenges and harness new
opportunities. Our goal is to present these insights in clear,
accessible language – avoiding technical jargon – so that a broad
audience can understand the significance of the census findings and
support evidence-based actions for agricultural development.</p>
<p>Before diving into the themes, it is worth noting how the
digital methodology of the 2024 census itself is a
game-changer. Unlike past paper-based counts, this census used
tablet-based data collection with geo-tagging of every agricultural
household, real-time dashboards for monitoring fieldwork, and instant
synchronization of data to a central server. This not
only improved accuracy and transparency ), but also
dramatically sped up processing – the results were compiled in just four
months after fieldwork. Such
innovations have set a “new gold standard” for large-scale data
collection in Pakistan. The rich,
geo-referenced dataset produced will enable more granular analysis and
targeted policy interventions than ever before. With that context, we
now turn to the substantive findings and their implications for
Pakistan’s agricultural future.</p>
<h2>Landholding
Patterns: Changing Farm Structures</h2>
<p>One of the most striking findings of the 2024 Agricultural Census is
the surge in the number of farms coupled with a decline
in average farm size, indicating ongoing land fragmentation. Pakistan
now has 11.7 million farm households operating
cropland, a dramatic increase from about 8.3 million farms recorded in
the 2010 census. In other
words, the count of farms grew by roughly 42% in fourteen years – far
outpacing population growth – largely due to subdivision of land among
heirs and incorporation of previously uncounted small holdings
(particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as discussed below). Total farmed
area also expanded (from ~52.9 to 59.3 million acres between 2010 and
2024) but much more modestly. Consequently, the average farm size has shrunk
from about 6.4 acres in 2010 to just 5.1 acres in 2024 nationally. The average cultivated land
per farm likewise dropped to ~4.5 acres, down from 5.2 acres in 2010. Smaller farm sizes can pose
a challenge for productivity, making it harder for farmers to achieve
economies of scale or justify investments in modern inputs and
machinery.</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates how farm numbers and sizes have
changed, both nationally and by province. We see a nationwide jump in
farm count (orange bars vs. yellow for 2010) and corresponding decline
in mean holding size in most regions. The provincial breakdown reveals important disparities.
Punjab – the breadbasket province – still has by far the largest share
of farms (over 5 million, around 43% of the country’s total). But
interestingly, Punjab’s farm count decreased slightly
since 2010. This may reflect consolidation in some areas or the
separation of Islamabad’s data. In
contrast, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) saw an explosion in
reported farms – rising to 4.17 million from only ~1.54 million in 2010. Part of this three-fold
increase is likely due to more comprehensive coverage of small upland
farms and previously unregistered holdings, enabled by the census’s
digital mapping and perhaps an expanded definition of “agricultural
household.” Regardless, KPK now accounts for over one-third of all farms
in Pakistan, second only to Punjab in count. Meanwhile,
Sindh also registered growth in farm numbers (1.83
million, up from 1.11 million) and Balochistan modest
growth. These patterns suggest that farming is increasingly
occurring on smaller plots and reaching into areas not thoroughly
counted before.</p>
<div class="article-image-full">

    <p class="article-image-caption">Figure 1: Change in number of farms and average farm size by province, 2010-2024. Farm counts rose sharply while average farm sizes declined in most provinces. Data source: Agricultural Census 2010 and 2024.</p>
</div>
<p>Corresponding to the proliferation of small farms is a notable shift
in land tenure patterns toward owner-operated farming.
The census reports that out of ~11.7 million total farms, 10.39
million are now owner-operated, a sharp increase from about
6.74 million owner farms in 2010. Owners thus represent 89% of all farms in 2024. In contrast, the
number of purely tenant farms (where land is rented) declined from
~0.916 million to 0.767 million over the same period. Even mixed owner-cum-tenant holdings slightly
decreased. This suggests that tenancy-based farming has
declined, and more farmers have acquired their own land or
converted rented land to ownership over the past decade. The trend could be due to various factors –
from government land distribution programs to farmers purchasing land
from retiring landlords, or tenants gaining ownership rights. In any
case, a national trend toward land ownership is
evident, which could empower farmers to make longer-term investments in
their land. However, it also raises questions about how the poorest
sharecroppers or landless laborers are faring – they may have been
excluded from tenancy or pushed into other sectors if renting
opportunities shrank.</p>
<p>At the provincial level, Punjab still contains the
largest absolute number of tenant farms (about 335 thousand tenant-only
farms), but this is much lower than before. Sindh retains a relatively
higher share of tenancy ), reflecting
the historical prevalence of landlord estates there – yet tenant farm
counts in Sindh also dropped. KPK and Balochistan always had
predominantly owner-operated smallholdings and continue to do so. The gender dimension of farm holdings is
another important aspect of landholding patterns. The census found that
only 1.5% of agricultural households are headed by
women, with 98.5% headed by men. This indicates a persistent gender gap in land ownership
and decision-making roles in agriculture. Social norms and inheritance
practices in Pakistan often result in male family members controlling
land assets. The low proportion of female-headed farms highlights an
area for policy attention, as women’s access to land and resources is
crucial for inclusive agricultural development.</p>
<p>Another revealing insight is the distribution of farms by
size categories, which shows a highly skewed structure.
Nationally, the vast majority of farms are very small: about 61%
of all farms are under 2.5 acres, and nearly 80% are smaller
than 5 acres. Yet these 80%
of smallest farms collectively operate only one-third of the total
agricultural land. In
contrast, a tiny fraction of farms are large: for example, holdings
above 50 acres constitute less than 0.5% of farms but account for ~9% of
land area. The “middle”
category of farms (say 5 to 25 acres) represents only about 20% of farms
but controls over half of all farmland. Figure 1 already showed how Balochistan
stands out with the highest average farm size (16 acres) and a
significant share of larger holdings. In Balochistan, only ~58% of farms
are below 5 acres (versus 76% in Punjab and a whopping 95% in KPK), and
about 10% of Balochistan’s farms exceed 12.5 acres – these larger
ranch-style holdings contribute to Balochistan’s average size being
three times the national average. Sindh also has somewhat larger farms on average
(5 acres) than the national mean, with a portion of big irrigated
estates still present. KPK, by contrast, has
extremely fragmented holdings – the average farm there is just 2.1 acres, and more than 40% of KPK’s
farms are under 1 acre. Punjab falls in between: average farm ~6
acres, with a mix of smallholders and some medium farms in its
canal-irrigated plains.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong> The landholding trends reveal
several challenges. First, the continuing fragmentation
of farms – while potentially empowering more families with land
– makes it difficult to raise productivity. Tiny, scattered plots
inhibit mechanization, efficient water use, and commercialization of
agriculture. Smallholders often struggle to access credit and markets,
and per-unit costs of inputs are higher. Second, though more
farms are owner-operated, many owners have extremely small parcels; land
inequality persists in terms of area distribution. A small elite of
large landowners still controls a disproportionate share of farmland
(especially in Sindh and parts of Punjab), which can influence rural
power dynamics and water access. Third, the gender
gap in land ownership means women farmers are largely invisible
in official land records, limiting their access to institutional support
(credit, extension services) that is tied to land title.
Finally, the decline in tenancy might indicate fewer
sharecropping opportunities for the landless; this could heighten rural
poverty if landless laborers have lost livelihoods (unless they found
alternatives). Overall, Pakistan’s landholding structure – dominated by
millions of marginal farms – is a structural constraint for growth and
also a key target for poverty alleviation efforts, since these small
farms support some of the poorest households.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Recommendations (Landholding Patterns):</strong> To
address fragmentation, the government can encourage land
consolidation or cooperative farming arrangements. Programs
that incentivize voluntary land pooling (e.g. through cooperatives or
community organizations) would allow small farmers to aggregate land for
joint mechanized cultivation, improving efficiency. Legal reforms could
make land leasing easier and more secure, so that small owners might
lease out or share operation of land without fear of losing ownership –
this would help form larger operational units. At the same time,
strengthening land rights for women is critical.
Simplifying inheritance procedures and raising awareness can ensure
women receive their due share of land; the state could support
female-led farms with targeted credit lines and training so that the
1.5% figure improves over time. For landless rural workers, the
government should consider reviving or expanding land
distribution schemes (allocating state land or purchased
private land to landless tenants) accompanied by support to make those
new small farms viable. Finally, improving the cadastral system through
digitization (building on the digital census data) will help in
formalizing land records, reducing disputes, and planning interventions.
In summary, policies that promote equitable land access, consolidation
for productivity, and inclusion of marginalized groups (women, landless)
are needed to turn the census’s landholding insights into a foundation
for more productive and just agriculture.</p>
<h2
id="irrigation-and-water-use-toward-efficiency-and-resilience">Irrigation
and Water Use: Toward Efficiency and Resilience</h2>
<p>Water is the lifeblood of Pakistan’s agriculture, and the census data
highlight both positive developments and ongoing vulnerabilities in
irrigation practices. A headline finding is that Pakistan’s agriculture
is becoming even more irrigation-intensive. In 2024,
out of 52.8 million acres of cultivated land, 45.94 million
acres are irrigated, which is about 87% of all
cropland. This represents a
notable increase from 2010, when roughly 34.1 million acres were
irrigated. In absolute terms, irrigated area expanded by almost 12
million acres over 14 years, while rain-fed (barani) farming area shrank
by nearly half – from ~8.4 million acres in 2010 down to only 4.96
million acres in 2024. This
shift toward irrigated agriculture is a double-edged
sword. On one hand, it reflects investments in irrigation infrastructure
and farmers’ adaptation to ensure water supply (which generally boosts
yields and reduces rainfall dependence). On the other hand, it
underscores growing water consumption in agriculture, raising concerns
about sustainability given Pakistan’s water-stressed environment.
Groundwater is being tapped at unprecedented rates to achieve this
coverage, and the overall irrigation efficiency remains low with
traditional methods.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the percentage of cultivated land
that is irrigated in each province, comparing 2010 and 2024. It is
evident that all provinces except Sindh improved their
irrigation coverage (Sindh was already extremely high and saw a
marginal dip). Punjab’s cultivated area is now 91% irrigated, up from
83%. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made
major gains – jumping from only 57% irrigated in 2010 to 73% in 2024 –
by adding many small irrigation schemes and tubewells. Balochistan saw the greatest relative
increase, from 62% to 80% of farmland irrigated, thanks to the spread of
tubewells, karez rehabilitations, and small dams in
that arid province. Sindh
remains the most irrigation-reliant region, with around 90% of its
farmland irrigated. The national capital region (ICT) and some
northern areas still have pockets of rain-fed agriculture, but overall,
barani farming is becoming confined to smaller pockets. The diminishing
rain-fed area ) is significant – it may indicate that some
marginal lands went out of cultivation, or that farmers managed to bring
irrigation (e.g. via tube wells or water harvesting) to lands that were
previously rain-dependent.</p>
<div class="article-image-full"> <img src="/images/insights/rethinking-pakistan-farm-economy-2024-agricultural-census-figure-2.png" alt="Figure 2: Share of cultivated land under irrigation, by province (2010 vs 2024).

with particularly large improvements in KPK and Balochistan. Data
source: Agricultural Census 2010 &amp; 2024.</p>
</div>
<p>The sources of irrigation water are another critical
aspect captured by the census. Pakistan’s irrigation system is
historically dominated by canals (from the Indus Basin Irrigation
System) supplemented by groundwater tubewells. The 2024 data show that
canal irrigation remains vital but groundwater use has become equally,
if not more, important in some areas. Out of the 45.9 million irrigated
acres, about 14.48 million acres are irrigated by canals
only. An additional ~13.5 million acres are irrigated
by a mix of canals and tubewells/pumps – this combined-method area actually saw a slight
decline from 13.9 million in 2010, perhaps due to more areas relying
exclusively on one source. Meanwhile, purely groundwater-driven
irrigation (wells and pumps without canals) is partially captured under
categories that the report lists as “Un-specified/Other sources,” which
expanded substantially to ~1.66 million acres. In provinces like Punjab, the majority of
canal-commanded areas also use tubewell supplements, which means
groundwater extraction is widespread. Punjab alone accounts for 27.09
million acres of irrigated land, the largest of any province; much of this is sustained by over one
million private tubewells tapping aquifers. Sindh has
about 7.32 million acres irrigated. KPK and
Balochistan have smaller absolute irrigated extents
), but rely on diverse sources: in KPK, canals cover some
areas but others depend on hill torrents and spring channels (rod-kohi),
while in Balochistan, farmers use ancient karez systems and modern
tubewells. Notably, the census confirms that traditional
methods like Rod-Kohi (spate irrigation from
hill torrents) and Karez (underground tunnel aquifers)
are “still functional” in parts of KPK and Balochistan, contributing
non-trivial amounts of irrigated acreage. Balochistan has 432,000 acres under karez or spring
irrigation combined,
reflecting the persistence of these community-managed systems despite
groundwater pumping.</p>
<p>A forward-looking inclusion in this census is data on modern
irrigation techniques. For the first time, farmers were asked
about sprinkler and drip irrigation systems (including
center-pivots). The results show very low adoption so far – only about
41,000 acres nationwide are irrigated by sprinkler/drip
methods. This is an almost
negligible fraction (&lt;0.1%) of total irrigated land. The number was
effectively zero or unrecorded in the 2010 data, so any increase is
positive, but clearly Pakistan has a long way to go in adopting
water-efficient irrigation. The low uptake may be due to high initial
costs, lack of technical knowledge, or the suitability of these systems
mainly for orchards and high-value crops. The census also identified
“tank/bandat” irrigation (small storage ponds or bunded
reservoirs) accounting for about 1.16 million acres in 2024,
suggesting growth in rainwater harvesting and small dam projects that
collect runoff for later use. This has been especially relevant in
northern KPK and upland Balochistan where canal infrastructure is
absent.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong> Pakistan’s expanding irrigation
frontiers come with serious challenges. Water resources are finite and
already under stress from climate change (glacier retreat, altered
monsoon patterns) and upstream usage. The census indicates
heavier reliance on groundwater, which raises the risk
of aquifer depletion. In many areas of Punjab and Balochistan,
groundwater is being extracted faster than it is replenished, leading to
falling water tables. Irrigation efficiency remains low
– the dominance of flood irrigation via canals and watercourses means a
lot of water is lost to seepage and evaporation before reaching crops.
The near-absence of drip/sprinkler adoption highlights a technological
gap in water-saving practices. Additionally, the inequities in water
distribution persist: large canal users in head areas often get surplus
water, while tail-end farmers struggle. Small farmers without tubewells
depend on canal timing and often suffer if rotations falter. Another
challenge is salinity and waterlogging, byproducts of
excessive canal irrigation in Sindh and southern Punjab, which render
land unproductive. As the census did not directly measure soil health,
this remains a hidden issue but one linked to water use patterns.
Finally, with 87% of agriculture under irrigation, the sector is
extremely vulnerable to any shocks in water supply – whether droughts,
infrastructure failures, or disputes in Indus water allocations. The
shrinking rain-fed area means less crop area acts as a buffer; if
irrigation supply falters, there is not much “rain-fed reserve” to rely
on.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Recommendations (Water Use):</strong> Ensuring
sustainable water use in agriculture is paramount. The census findings
make a strong case for investing in modern irrigation
technology at scale. Government programs should subsidize and
promote drip and sprinkler systems, especially for
water-intensive crops and in water-scarce regions. These technologies
can improve water-use efficiency by 30-60%. Pilot projects have shown
success, but adoption needs to move beyond pilot to mainstream.
Alongside hardware, farmers need training on these systems and on basic
water-saving agronomy (like laser land leveling, bed
planting, etc., which reduce water needs). Groundwater
regulation is another priority – currently, tube wells are
largely unregulated. Policies could introduce a permit or fee system for
large-capacity wells and encourage community management of aquifers.
Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater should be optimized
(e.g. using canals when available and resting aquifers). Moreover,
canal infrastructure must be modernized: lining
canals/watercourses in critical reaches, automating gates, and using
telemetry to monitor flows can cut losses and ensure more equitable
distribution. The census’s geo-tagged data can help identify which areas
lack irrigation or suffer from tail-end supply issues, allowing targeted
canal rehabilitation projects. In saline areas, investments in
drainage and salinity control are needed (such as reuse
of saline water or bio-saline agriculture for affected lands). Lastly,
building resilience is key: Pakistan should expand small-scale water
storage (like the “tank/bandat” approach) in rain-fed zones to harvest
runoff and buffer dry spells. Rain-fed agriculture shouldn’t be
neglected – it can be made more resilient with drought-tolerant crops
and water harvesting, providing a safety net when irrigation is
insufficient. By accelerating the shift to efficient irrigation and
better water governance, Pakistan can sustain its agricultural growth
without running its wells dry.</p>
<h2>Livestock
Trends: Booming Numbers and Opportunities</h2>
<p>The 7th Agricultural Census integrated a full livestock
census, providing an updated picture of Pakistan’s livestock
population after nearly two decades (the last standalone livestock
census was in 2006). The results confirm that Pakistan has seen a
livestock boom – a massive increase in the number of
cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and other animals that far outpaces human
population growth. As of 2024, the country hosts an estimated
251.3 million head of livestock, up from approximately 142.7
million in 2006. This
equates to an average growth of about 3.2% per year. Figure 3 (left panel) illustrates the growth for major
species, while the table below provides the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goats: 95.8 million in 2024, up from 53.8 million
in 2006.
Goats are the most numerous livestock, reflecting their popularity with
smallholders due to low input requirements and adaptability.</li>
<li>Cattle (cows and bulls): 55.86 million, almost
double the 29.56 million in 2006. Cattle growth has been fueled by rising demand for beef and the
use of cattle in dairy production (especially cross-bred cows for
milk).</li>
<li>Buffaloes: 47.74 million, up from 27.33 million. Buffaloes (the prime dairy
animal in Pakistan) have also nearly doubled, indicating substantial
growth in the dairy sector. Pakistan’s buffalo herd is among the largest
in the world now, providing the bulk of milk consumed.</li>
<li>Sheep: 44.59 million, up from 26.49 million. Sheep are
important in pastoral areas and for wool/mutton; their growth, while
significant, is slower relative to goats.</li>
</ul>
<div class="article-image-full"> <img src="/images/insights/rethinking-pakistan-farm-economy-2024-agricultural-census-figure-3.png" alt="Figure 3: Growth in Pakistan’s livestock population between 2006 and 2024.

Other livestock (asses, camels, horses, mules) also increased,
though at varying rates. Data source: Pakistan Livestock Census 2006 and
Agricultural Census 2024.</p>
</div>
<p>These increases underscore that livestock is the most dynamic
sub-sector of agriculture today – indeed it contributes about
63% of agricultural GDP and around 3% of total exports. The census data specifically note
that Punjab holds the largest share of the national herd, leading in cattle and buffalo numbers.
Punjab alone has 26.97 million cattle and 29.56 million
buffaloes. This aligns with Punjab’s status as the
heart of Pakistan’s milk production – its mix of small and commercial
dairy farms have proliferated. Sindh follows with
roughly 50.0 million total animals, including a strong buffalo population (13.46 million) and cattle. Sindh’s
irrigated agriculture supports many buffalo and cattle in mixed
crop-livestock systems, especially around urban centers with high milk
demand. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) has about 48.7 million
animals, notable for having
more goats (22.49 million) than any other province except Punjab. Goats thrive in KP’s hills,
and the province uniquely also has yak/dzomo (about
2,000 head, a type of high-altitude cattle) in its far north. Balochistan accounts
for ~47.9 million livestock,
distinguished by the largest share of camels (0.772
million, over 50% of the national camel herd) and a very large
population of sheep (18.8 million, the highest of any province) as well
as goats. This
reflects Balochistan’s arid rangelands and nomadic pastoral
traditions.</p>
<p>The right panel of Figure 3 shows trends for “other” livestock:
asses (donkeys) increased slightly from 4.27 million
(2006) to 4.90 million; horses grew from 0.34 to 0.553 million;
mules from 0.16 to 0.297 million; and
camels from 0.92 to 1.51 million. The equine population (horses, mules, donkeys)
is relatively static or slow-growing compared to ruminants, likely
because mechanization is gradually reducing the use of draft animals.
Still, nearly 5 million donkeys is a reminder that pack
animals remain important for transport in many rural areas and
peri-urban economies (Pakistan actually has one of the largest donkey
populations globally). The camel increase (64% over 18
years) suggests that camels remain valuable in certain communities for
transport, milk, or meat, and perhaps climate change favors hardier
camels in desertifying areas. Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), not
shown in the figure due to its tiny share, has only around 0.36 million
total animals – less than 1% of the national herd.</p>
<p>This livestock expansion presents both opportunities and challenges.
On the positive side, a larger livestock herd has underpinned growth in
milk and meat production. Pakistan is now one of the
top producers of milk globally. The census data imply that the
buffalo population growth (and improved per-animal yields) has driven
milk output upward; the Economic Survey 2024-25 reported a 3.2% annual
increase in milk production recently.
Meat production (beef, mutton, poultry) has also been rising around 2–3%
annually. The booming goat population is
particularly significant for meat supply (goat meat is
culturally preferred as mutton). Livestock also serve as a “living bank”
for rural households – a form of savings and insurance that can be sold
or exchanged in times of need. The census’s integration of livestock
data allows us to see how many agricultural households rely on
livestock: out of ~19.8 million agricultural households, about
8.1 million do not have cropland, implying these are purely livestock (or machinery)
households. This means millions of families, especially in pastoral
areas and rain-fed zones, depend entirely on livestock for their
livelihood. Policies must not overlook these households who might not
till land but raise animals.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong> The huge increase in livestock
numbers also raises red flags. One is the question of feed and
fodder availability. Does Pakistan have enough feed resources
(green fodder, crop residues, feed concentrates) to adequately nourish
250+ million animals In many regions, feed shortages already lead to
low productivity – animals are often underfed, especially in dry
seasons. Overstocking can lead to rangeland degradation, as seen in
Balochistan where communal grazing lands are under pressure. Another
challenge is animal health: With more animals, the risk
and incidence of diseases (foot-and-mouth disease, PPR in goats,
brucellosis, etc.) can rise if veterinary services don’t keep pace. The
census indicates that only a small fraction of livestock households are
commercial; most are smallholders with poor access to vet care and
breeding services. This contributes to low per-animal productivity. For
example, despite being the 2nd largest milk producer, Pakistan’s milk
yield per cow/buffalo is much lower than global benchmarks due to local
breeds and suboptimal feeding. There is also an environmental
impact to consider – more ruminants mean more methane emissions
(Pakistan’s livestock are a major source of greenhouse gases), and
unmanaged waste from livestock can pollute water bodies. Additionally,
rapid growth in livestock without modern management raises
quality and value-chain issues: how to ensure milk
hygiene, how to connect the surplus animals to markets efficiently, etc.
Currently, a lot of potential (in meat exports, dairy processing)
remains untapped partly because of fragmented production and lack of
cold chains. Finally, the census’s livestock data expose some regional
vulnerabilities – e.g., Balochistan’s economy is heavily
livestock-dependent, so droughts or animal disease outbreaks there have
outsized impacts on incomes. Similarly, areas with large livestock
holdings need strategies for climate adaptation, as animals can suffer
in extreme heat or floods (witnessed in recent years’ floods where
thousands of livestock perished).</p>
<p><strong>Policy Recommendations (Livestock):</strong> To capitalize on
the livestock boom and mitigate its downsides, Pakistan needs a
multi-pronged livestock development strategy. First,
enhance feed and fodder production – this can be done
by incentivizing fodder crops (improved varieties of sorghum, berseem,
etc.), promoting silage making and feed conservation for lean periods,
and using crop residues efficiently (the integrated data show where
crop-livestock integration is high, and those linkages should be
strengthened). Research into high-yielding fodder and efficient feed
formulations will support the growing herd. Second, invest in
veterinary services and disease control. Expanding the
network of para-vets in villages, mass vaccination campaigns (for FMD,
PPR, etc.), and surveillance systems will protect animal health. The
census data can help identify pockets with high livestock density where
vet resources should be concentrated. Third, pursue genetic
improvement for higher productivity: implementing breed
improvement programs (through artificial insemination or community
breeding centers) especially for cattle and buffalo can gradually
improve milk and meat yields per animal, meaning fewer animals could
produce the same output – easing pressure on resources. Indigenous
breeds that are climate-resilient (like Sahiwal cattle, Azikheli
buffalo, etc.) should be conserved and improved rather than replaced
wholesale. Fourth, empower the many small livestock
keepers through training and organization. Supporting dairy
cooperatives or meat producer associations can help smallholders gain
market access and bargaining power. For example, milk collection systems
can be expanded so that even small farmers can sell surplus milk to
cooling centers, improving incomes and reducing waste. Providing
microcredit for women who often manage backyard poultry and small
ruminants will further uplift household nutrition and income – women are
key players in livestock care in rural Pakistan, though they seldom
receive formal support.</p>
<p>Finally, the government should leverage the growing herd for economic
gains by developing value chains: improving
slaughterhouses, meat processing facilities, and quality control to meet
export standards could turn the livestock surge into export earnings
(Pakistan’s halal meat export potential is still largely untapped). At
the same time, extension services should promote environmental best
practices – like biogas from animal waste, rotational grazing to protect
rangelands, and improved manure management to reduce emissions and
produce organic fertilizer. By viewing livestock not just as numbers to
celebrate but as an evolving system to manage, Pakistan can ensure this
livestock wealth translates into nutrition security, income growth, and
export revenue without degrading the resource base.</p>
<h2>Farm Mechanization:
Modernizing Agriculture</h2>
<p>Agricultural mechanization in Pakistan has historically lagged behind
comparators, but the 2024 census provides some encouraging signs as well
as areas needing progress. The integrated census collected data on
ownership of farm machinery (like tractors, harvesters, tube wells,
etc.) as part of the agricultural household survey. While the full
detailed results on machinery are not excerpted in the summary report,
previous machinery censuses and ancillary information can help
contextualize the likely trends. The overall impression is that
mechanization has increased over the past decades – for
instance, the number of tractors in Pakistan has risen significantly –
yet many small farms still rely on traditional tools or animate power
(bullocks/donkeys) for farm operations.</p>
<p>According to the last Agricultural Machinery Census in 2004, Pakistan
had about 401,663 tractors in use, which was already a substantial increase from roughly 253,000 in
1994 and 157,000 in 1984. By linear
extrapolation and considering domestic production, it is likely that by
2024 the tractor fleet has roughly doubled from the 2004 level (possibly
on the order of 800,000+ tractors in the country).
Indeed, Pakistan’s domestic tractor industry manufactures 50,000–70,000
units in good years, although economic
slowdowns have caused fluctuations. The census likely captured data on
how many agricultural households own tractors. Many medium to large
farmers have acquired tractors due to government subsidy schemes and
credit programs over the years (e.g. the Punjab government’s “Green
Tractor” subsidy in the 2010s). We can infer that ownership is
concentrated: Punjab and Sindh, with their larger farm sizes and higher
incomes, probably account for the bulk of tractors, while in KPK and
Balochistan fewer households own tractors but they may use communal or
hired services when needed. For example, Balochistan saw a 106% growth
in tractor numbers between 1994 and 2004, reflecting efforts to mechanize in
canal-irrigated pockets of that province.</p>
<p>Beyond tractors, tube wells and irrigation pumps are
another critical form of “mechanization” (motive power applied to water
extraction). The census data on irrigation sources indicate that there
are well over a million private tube wells now operating (given the area
under groundwater irrigation). The spread of affordable diesel and
electric pumps since the 2000s enabled many farmers in Punjab and
Balochistan especially to install their own wells – mechanizing the
water supply. Other machinery includes harvesting and
post-harvest equipment. The census for the first time covered
combine harvesters usage; Pakistan has seen increasing use of combine
harvesters for wheat and rice harvest in the past decade, mostly through
custom service providers who move machines from field to field. Still,
the density of combine harvesters is low relative to crop area.
Threshers for wheat and maize are very common (often owned at village
level), and small-scale machinery like chaff cutters, sugarcane
crushers, and rice husking machines are widespread in farming
communities. Another new aspect captured is greenhouse and
tunnel farming technology – the report mentions that the census
covered adoption of greenhouse and tunnel farming practices. This likely shows up as a relatively
small number of farms (probably a few thousand) using plastic tunnels
for off-season vegetable production or nurseries under greenhouse cover,
mostly in peri-urban areas. It’s a nascent trend but an important one
for high-value agriculture.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, most smallholders remain
under-mechanized. A telling statistic: with (roughly estimated)
0.8–1.0 million tractors for 11.7 million farms, there is roughly 1
tractor per 12–15 farms. In reality, among farms under 5 acres (80% of
all farms), very few own machinery – they typically either hire tractors
or continue to use animal traction for plowing and transport. The
census’s definition of “agricultural household” included those owning
agricultural machinery even if they had no land. Such “machinery-only” households are likely
those who run tractor rental businesses or custom services. The
existence of these suggests a developing market for mechanization
services, which is a positive trend; farmers who cannot afford their own
tractor can rent one relatively easily in many areas. Nonetheless,
constraints like high fuel costs and fragmented land (making it hard for
tractors to maneuver in tiny plots) limit usage. Mechanization is not
just about tractors – it also includes power tillers, planters,
sprayers, and other implements. Adoption of these implements,
especially precision planters or drip irrigation pumps, is still limited
outside progressive farms. Many processes (like planting, weeding,
picking of cotton, harvesting of sugarcane) remain labor-intensive and
could benefit from mechanization or improved tools.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges:</strong> One major challenge is the
affordability and scale-appropriateness of machinery
for small farms. A tractor is a costly asset ). Small farmers usually cannot purchase such equipment without
subsidies or group ownership. Even smaller machines like walking
tractors or specialized planters may be out of reach. This leads to a
situation where mechanization can widen inequalities – larger farmers
forge ahead with technology while smallholders lag. Another challenge is
the lack of mechanization in certain tasks, resulting
in inefficiency and crop losses. For example, despite more tractors for
land prep, the absence of affordable harvest machinery for crops like
cotton means harvest is manual, which can be slow and result in wastage.
Similarly, limited mechanization in post-harvest handling (drying,
storage) contributes to significant losses. The maintenance and
quality of machinery is also an issue: many tractors in use are
old and overhauled; extension services for machinery (guiding farmers on
proper use and upkeep) are minimal. Fragmented lands and small fields in
many parts of KPK and Punjab make it physically difficult for large
machines to operate, reducing the benefit of owning them. Lastly, a
newer challenge is the human resource aspect – as
mechanization expands, there is a need for skilled operators, mechanics,
and spare parts supply chains, which rural areas often lack. Introducing
new tech like precision planters or drones requires training that is
currently scarce.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Recommendations (Mechanization):</strong> To boost
farm mechanization in an inclusive manner, the government and private
sector should collaborate on several fronts. Subsidy and credit
schemes targeted at small and medium farmers can help them
acquire appropriate machinery. Pakistan has experience with tractor
subsidy programs; future schemes should perhaps focus on smaller
equipment (laser levelers, planters, etc.) and could be disbursed via
matching grants. Promoting mechanization service
providers is key – rather than each small farm owning a
tractor, a rural entrepreneur could own one and provide services to
dozens of farmers. This model can be strengthened by offering
low-interest loans to such service providers and establishing machinery
pools at the village or union council level. Research and
development should aim at “right-sized” machinery for
Pakistan’s conditions – for instance, two-wheel walking tractors or mini
combined harvesters suitable for 2-5 acre farms, which countries like
China and Thailand have developed, could be introduced via trials and
subsidies. The government can reduce import duties on specialized farm
machinery not made locally to improve access.</p>
<p>Capacity building is also important: establishing training
centers for machinery operation and repair would create a cadre
of local youth skilled in running and fixing farm equipment, creating
jobs and supporting mechanization. Extension services should include a
mechanization wing that advises farmers on which implements save labor
or improve yields (for example, educating farmers on zero-till drills
for wheat sowing into rice stubble, which has shown success in Punjab).
Additionally, encouraging innovative technologies
through pilot projects – such as solar-powered irrigation pumps (to
reduce diesel costs and emissions), or the use of drones for crop
spraying – could demonstrate efficacy and build demand if results are
positive. The census’s identification of modern practices like
greenhouse and drip irrigation adoption suggests pockets of innovation;
these could be scaled up by providing technical support and access to
finance. Crucially, mechanization policy must integrate with land and
water policies: as land consolidates (even via cooperative use) and as
irrigation becomes more reliable, the stage is set for higher
mechanization, which in turn can boost productivity and reduce
post-harvest losses. With thoughtful policies, Pakistan can leapfrog to
more advanced and climate-smart farm machinery, ensuring that even
smallholders benefit from the labor-saving and income-boosting potential
of mechanization.</p>
<h2
id="digital-data-collection-a-new-era-for-agricultural-statistics">Digital
Data Collection: A New Era for Agricultural Statistics</h2>
<p>The 7th Agricultural Census was not only about counting farms and
animals – it was also a pioneering exercise in how data are collected.
Termed an “Integrated Digital Count,” this census
leveraged technology to improve accuracy, transparency, and timeliness.
It’s worth reflecting on these innovations, as they have implications
for governance and future data efforts in Pakistan’s agriculture
sector.</p>
<p>Traditionally, censuses in Pakistan were paper-based: enumerators
would fill paper questionnaires, which would then be manually coded and
entered into computers – a slow process prone to errors. In 2024,
however, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) deployed tablet
computers with custom software to all field enumerators. Each agricultural household
surveyed was geo-tagged with coordinates, meaning the
location of farms and livestock holdings are now mapped. Supervisors
could monitor progress in real-time via GIS dashboards
and a centralized system that showed how many households in each area
had been counted. If any
area was missed or if data showed anomalies, corrective teams could be
dispatched quickly. This real-time monitoring, combined with a
complaint management hotline for the public to report
if their household was missed, greatly enhanced coverage and confidence in the data. The census
was executed in two phases – splitting the operation ensured seasonal constraints
didn’t hinder access. With digital tools, the PBS was able to complete
data collection and processing for a massive 19.8 million households by
mid-2025, whereas previous censuses would take years to publish
results.</p>
<p>Another achievement was integrating three domains (agriculture,
livestock, machinery) into one questionnaire. This required significant
training and coordination. The PBS trained master
trainers from each province, including staff from agriculture extension,
livestock departments, etc., who in turn trained district enumerators. The tablets had built-in
checks – for instance, if an enumerator entered an improbably large
number of animals for a small household, the software could flag it,
reducing data entry errors. The use of an upgraded data
center at PBS for processing meant that all the information
flowed into a central database securely each day. Cost-wise, while purchasing tablets and
developing software is an upfront expense, PBS noted that using its
in-house data center and digital approach actually reduced
costs compared to a lengthy paper census. Importantly, the digital census approach
enhances data granularity. Now that each household is
geo-referenced, policymakers can drill down to very local levels – for
example, analyzing village-level farm size distribution or mapping
hotspots of a particular livestock species. This spatial dimension is
invaluable for targeted interventions (like knowing exactly which areas
have many tube wells impacting groundwater).</p>
<p>The success of the digital census demonstrates capacity that can be
utilized for other surveys. It sets a precedent for conducting
large-scale surveys in Pakistan with technology, improving overall
governance. For farmers and stakeholders, it means data is more current
and reliable. The year 2024 will not be remembered just for the numbers
it measured, but for transforming the statistical
system behind those numbers. The PBS has effectively built a
digital sampling frame of agriculture that can be updated or used for
more frequent surveys, rather than waiting another decade. They have
also engaged stakeholders in a
technologically savvy operation, which bodes well for future
collaborations.</p>
<p><strong>Key Challenges and Next Steps:</strong> While the digital
census was a success, maintaining and utilizing the wealth of data
collected is the next challenge. Data must be analyzed and disseminated
widely – not just in a static report but through interactive platforms
or open data portals so that researchers, provincial planners, and even
farmers’ organizations can leverage it. Privacy and data security need
to be ensured when sharing granular data. Another challenge is to
institutionalize the digital methods: PBS and
provincial stats offices should preserve the tablets, software, and
skills for the next rounds of surveys. Technology evolves rapidly, so
continued investment in upgrading software (perhaps moving to even
smartphone-based systems or adding remote sensing integration) will be
needed. The human element is key too – the enthusiasm and training of
enumerators was vital; keeping that pool of trained personnel engaged
for interim surveys (like annual crop surveys or livestock sample
surveys) could maximize the return on training investment.</p>
<p>One limitation observed was that some remote areas had connectivity
issues; enumerators sometimes collected data offline on tablets and
uploaded later. Expanding rural connectivity (internet access) will make
such digital efforts smoother. Lastly, there is a need to integrate the
agricultural census data with other digital data – for example, linking
it with the digital population census 2023 data, or land records
digitization, to unlock deeper insights. If, say, land ownership records
become digital, one could overlay them with the census farm locations to
address land tenure formalization. Similarly, linking livestock numbers
with veterinary clinic locations can show service gaps. These
integrations require inter-departmental cooperation and data-sharing
agreements that should be pursued.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Recommendations (Digital Data Utilization):</strong>
The government should establish a mechanism to ensure continuous
use and updating of the digital agricultural data. One idea is
to create an Agriculture Data Dashboard for Pakistan –
a public platform where key census indicators are mapped and updated
with new survey data or remote sensing (e.g., crop acreage estimates
from satellites). This would keep data alive and useful for
decision-making on things like input distribution or disaster relief
(knowing which areas have many livestock to vaccinate, for instance).
The PBS could collaborate with the Ministry of National Food Security
&amp; Research to conduct more frequent sample-based
surveys (e.g. every 1–2 years) using the census frame and
tablets, focusing on specific topics like crop yields or farm incomes.
This would address the data gaps between censuses. It’s also recommended
to document the lessons learned from this digital
census in detail and perhaps offer training to other national
statistical offices in the region – Pakistan’s success can be a model
for others in South Asia.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, having this rich data is an opportunity to
practice evidence-based policymaking in agriculture.
For each of the themes discussed (land, water, livestock, etc.),
policymakers can target interventions more precisely. For example,
knowing exactly where small farms are concentrated and lack
mechanization can help in planning custom hiring centers there. Or
knowing livestock densities can inform where to build new vet hospitals.
Therefore, a recommendation is for each provincial agriculture
department to set up a data analysis unit that works
with PBS data to inform its policies. Capacity building in data
analytics at the provincial level will help translate numbers into
action. Lastly, planning for the next census should
start early – given the decision to move to a five-year cycle, the next
integrated census might be in 2029. Continuous improvement of the
questionnaire (perhaps adding modules on emerging issues like climate
adaptation practices or precision agriculture) and the tech platform
will ensure that future data is even more relevant.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 7th Agricultural Census 2024 offers a comprehensive and
up-to-date mirror for Pakistan’s agriculture – reflecting significant
changes over the past decade and illuminating where interventions are
needed. The key themes that emerge from the data tell a
story of both progress and persistent challenges. Land is more
subdivided than ever, yet more farmers own their land outright,
providing a basis for empowerment if matched with support for
smallholders. Water usage has intensified with irrigation expansion,
improving resilience to rainfall variability but raising alarms for
sustainable management. Livestock have proliferated, opening avenues for
increased dairy and meat production, but also demanding better feed,
health, and market systems to avoid resource strain. Mechanization is
gradually taking root, especially benefiting larger farms, while the
vast smallholder majority still awaits appropriate technology to ease
their labor burden and improve productivity. And cross-cutting all these
is the advent of digital data collection, which has revolutionized how
we understand the agricultural landscape and should likewise
revolutionize how we plan and monitor agricultural policies.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Pakistan’s policymakers are equipped with an
unprecedented level of detail from this census – down to each tehsil and
village. The data underscores the need for differentiated
strategies: what works in Punjab’s canal-irrigated villages
(e.g. enhancing mechanization and value-addition for dairy) might not
work in Balochistan’s pastoral communities, where water infrastructure
and rangeland management are priorities. Provincial analyses, as
included in the census report, should guide provincial budgets and
programs. Federally, the census supports initiatives under the National
Food Security Policy and the Agriculture Transformation Plan by
identifying gaps – for instance, the low adoption of modern irrigation
justifies boosting the ongoing water-saving schemes, and the
fragmentation of land suggests urgency in extension approaches tailored
to small farms.</p>
<p>Crucially, the census highlights the human dimension
of agriculture – nearly 20 million households are engaged in this sector. Policies, therefore, must
center on improving livelihoods: raising incomes of small farmers,
making farming attractive and viable for youth (who might otherwise exit
agriculture), and ensuring food security for all. With climate change
impacts accelerating (as seen by recent floods and droughts), the rich
dataset can help climate-smart planning – identifying which areas and
farming systems are most vulnerable and tracking adoption of adaptation
measures over time.</p>
<p>The commentary above has provided specific recommendations under each
theme, but some overarching recommendations bear repeating: invest in
agricultural research and extension (to improve yields
and resource efficiency so that small farms can be productive); improve
rural infrastructure (farm-to-market roads, storage,
electricity for value addition) to support the structural transformation
of agriculture; and strengthen institutions and markets
(such as cooperatives, commodity boards, and digital marketplaces) so
that farmers can get fair prices and access services. The government
should also maintain the momentum in data systems – the agriculture
census should not be a once-in-a-decade splash but part of a culture of
evidence where progress is measured and transparent. The success of the
digital census shows that Pakistan can execute complex reforms; similar
resolve is needed to implement the policy reforms indicated by the
census evidence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Pakistan’s 2024 agricultural census does more than
count farms and livestock – it shines a light on the path to a more
modern, efficient, and equitable agricultural sector. By heeding the
lessons from the data and acting on the recommendations for land, water,
livestock, mechanization, and data use, policymakers can help transform
Pakistani agriculture from a low-productivity, vulnerable sector into a
high-value, sustainable enterprise that ensures food security, raises
rural incomes, and contributes robustly to national development. The
coming years will test our ability to translate data into action; with
collective effort, the seeds of progress captured in this census can be
nurtured into a bounty of prosperity for Pakistan’s farmers and
consumers alike.</p>
